      <p>This photo was taken on my way from Launceston to Hobart. The city of Launceston gave me a very comfortable
        feeling. When I left, I was very reluctant, so I sat in the car and took the photo. Scaled up the width of the
        photo to make it look like a painting.

      <div>
        <p>Took these three pictures in the morning in Queenstown, I had breakfast at the only restaurant in town that
          is open very early and took picture two. At that time, the sky was taking a walk in the streets of the town in
          the drizzle to take the first picture, and the third picture was taken with a drone, looking at Queenstown
          from the sky.</p>

      <p>This photo was taken at night with a long exposure. There are dense stars in the sky. When I finished taking
        the photo, I was shocked by the clean land on the ground, echoing the pure starry sky, and there is a road
        leading to the distance in the middle.</p>
